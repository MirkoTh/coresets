                    Make sure you have a good internet connection from the beginning to the end of the study.
                    Disconnections will cause problems in displaying visuals and we will not be able to use your data.

            <h1>Information on tasks and purpose of the study</h4>
                Today, you are carrying out various tasks with friendly monsters.<br>
                You are randomly going to be assigned to one of several conditions. <br>
                Depending on the condition you are in, you are going to carry out a subset of the following tasks:
                <ul class="centeredtext">
                    <li><b>Memory:</b> Remember a monster on every trial as precisely as possible</li>
                    <li><b>Similarity:</b> Use your memory to compare the monster from the current trial to the monster
                        of
                        the previous trial; again as precisely as possible</li>
                    <li><b>Category Learning</b>: The monsters come from different tribes; learn to categorize them into
                        the
                        tribes they come from over several trials</li>
                </ul> <br>
                The purpose of the study is to gain knowledge about how people mentally represent two-dimensional
                information.<br>
                On the next page you will get detailed instructions about the specific combination of tasks you
                are going to carry out.
                <br>

                depending on
                your performance.<br>
                Please note that this is going to be a <b>long and challenging </b>study!</b><br>

                <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
                Your participation in this study will remain confidential.
                Your Prolific ID will NOT be shared with anyone outside the research team.

                and after clicking the button re-directing you to the prolific webpage and storing your completion code.

                <h4>How to contact the researchers?</h4>
                If you have questions or concerns about your participation or payment
                please email the <a href="mailto:mirko.thalmann@tuebingen.mpg.de">researcher</a>
                or the <a href="mailto:eric.schulz@tuebingen.mpg.de">principal investigator</a>.


                <h4>Data protection</h4>
                Your data will be anonymized and only used in the manner described in our data protection sheet,
                available <a href="https://kyblab.tuebingen.mpg.de/t-reps/data_protection.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
                (please do not fill out this sheet!).
                The following text box summarizes the main points. Please read it carefully and provide consent
                below:<br>

                <textarea rows="15" cols="100" readonly>
                    The processing and use of the collected data occurs in a pseudoanonymized form within the scope of the legally prescribed provisions.
                    As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of answered questionnaires, as well as electronic data, for a duration of 10 years or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.

                    By providing of further personal data in pseudoanonymized form, collected personal data may be used for the preparation of anonymized
                    scientific research work and may also be published and used in an anonymized form in medical journals and scientific publications, so that a direct assignment to my person cannot be established.

                    The information obtained during the course of this study may also be sent in an anonymized form to cooperation partners within the scope of
                    the European General Data Protection Regulation for scientific purposes and to cooperation partners outside of the European Union, i.e. to countries with a lower data protection level (this also applies to the USA).

                    The data collected within the scope of the study can also be used and processed in the future inside of the Max Planck Institute.

                    I was informed about my rights, that at any time:

                    I can withdraw this declaration of consent.

                    I can request information about my stored data and request the correction or blocking of data.

                    By cancellation of my participation in the study,
                    I can request that any personal data of mine collected until that point are immediately deleted or anonymized.

                    I can request that my personal data are handed out to me or to third parties (if technically feasible).

                    I herewith declare that:

                    I have been adequately informed about the collection and processing of my personal data and rights.

                    I consent to the collection and processing of personal data within the scope of the study and its pseudoanonymized disclosure,
                    so that only the persons conducting the study can establish a link between the data and my person.

                    Agreement:

                    I agree to participate in this study.

                    I consent to the use of my data described in the Data Protection Information Sheet
                    and confirm having received a copy of the Data Protection Sheet.

                    I consent to data transfer from the MPI for Biological Cybernetics encrypted database to the project-related collaborators:
                    inside of the Max Planck Society and affiliated research institutes, or at partnering institutions like the University of Tuebingen.

            <h1>Welcome to Planet Rodrak</h1>
            <br>
            Today, you find yourself in <b>Planet Rodrak</b>.<br>
            Your task is to learn which images the alien Mira likes.<br>
            Possible images could look like the following:
            <div>
                <img src="stimuli/stimulus[1,1].png" height="300px">
                <img src="stimuli/stimulus[100,100].png" height="300px">
            </div></br>
            <br>
            These are just two examples, though.<br>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <p>
                Your session today will be split up into two tasks:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Mira's preferences:</b>On every trial you are presented with an object.<br>
                    Your task is to learn which objects Mira likes and which one not.<br>
                    If you think, Mira likes the object, press the 'F' button on the keyboard.<br>
                    If you think, Mira does not like the object, press the 'J' button on the keyboard.<br>
                    You will get help via feedback on every trial.<br>
                    <b> --> Takes approx. 10 min</b><br>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Recognition:</b>You are going to see the objects presented in 'Mira's preferences' together with
                    new objects.<br>
                    Your task is to say if you have seen the respective object presented on a given trial or not as
                    accurately and quickly as possible.<br>
                    If the object has been presented before, press the 'J' button.<br>
                    If the object has not been presented before, press the 'F' button.<br>
                    <b> --> Takes approx. 10 min</b><br>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Mira's preferences reloaded:</b>The task is similar to 'Mira's preferences'.<br>
                    You again have to say if Mira likes the object or not. However, this time, you will not get any
                    feedback to sharpen your understanding of Mira's preferences.<br>
                    Please use again the same response buttons as in the first part:<br>
                    If you think, Mira likes the object, press the 'F' button on the keyboard.<br>
                    If you think, Mira does not like the object, press the 'J' button on the keyboard.<br>
                    <b> --> Takes approx. 10 min</b><br>
                </li>
            </ol>
